Release Notes
-------------

- Version 1.0-alpha
  Release date: 2011-11-30
  
  Features:
  * Application build on Drupal-6.22
  * Create a metadata record for a data asset via a web form or a file upload
  * Apply an approval workflow for metadata records
  * Manage users and organizations
  * Create metric reports
  * Manage contents through Drupal's native functionalities
  
  Known Issues:
  * While inserting a metadata extension (such as U.S. Data Policy),
    the Agency Responsible field value does not default to user's agency value.
    [Flexi-Field issue as reported on http://drupal.org/node/592888]
  * While entering extension fields, incorrect validation messages are displayed.
    This does not prevent the user from correctly saving data and proceeding.
    [http://drupal.org/node/390480]
  * Bulk operation console messages do not convey the correct result.
    Messages only show that an operation has been carried out on a node,
    and does not show the actual result of the workflow operation.
    [Limitation from the Workflow module]
  * XML file upload is currently disabled until the metadata schema is finalized,
    and an XSD can be generated to validate uploads against.
